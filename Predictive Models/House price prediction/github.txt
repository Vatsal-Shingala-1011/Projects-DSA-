# 4. Relevant Information:

#    Concerns housing values in suburbs of Boston.

# 5. Number of Instances: 506

# 6. Number of Attributes: 13 continuous attributes (including "class"
#                          attribute "MEDV"), 1 binary-valued attribute.

# 7. Attribute Information:

#     1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
#                ->CRIM = (Total number of reported crimes) / (Population of the town)
#     2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
#                ->ZN variable is expressed as a percentage.
#     3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
#     4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
#                  river; 0 otherwise)
#     5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
#     6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
#     7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
#     8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
#                ->The "DIS" variable is calculated by considering the distances from each town to five major employment centers 
#                  in Boston. These employment centers could include business districts, industrial areas, or other places with 
#                  a high concentration of job opportunities.
#     9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways.
#                  ->The "RAD" variable is an index that quantifies the proximity of each town to the radial highways. 
#                  ->Radial highways are major roads or expressways that lead from the city center to the outskirts or neighboring 
#                    towns and cities in a radial pattern.
#     10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
#     11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
#     12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
#                ->The "B" variable is used as an indicator of the proportion of Black residents in each town. It is based on 
#                  the "Bk" variable, which represents the percentage of the town's population that identifies as Black or African
#                  American.
#                ->The formula 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 scales and transforms the "Bk" variable to highlight the differences
#                  in the proportion of Black residents across different towns. The value of "B" will be higher for towns with a 
#                  higher percentage of Black residents, and it will be lower for towns with a lower percentage of Black residents.
    
#     13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
#     14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
#                ->label

# 8. Missing Attribute Values:  None.
